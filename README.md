# Written-Papers
This repository contains different literature reviews I have written.

The Effect of Gamification on E-learning (Research Methodology Paper):
This work started by explaining gamification and e-learning as two separate concepts. It then focused on how e-learning can be improved via gamification, discussing gamification designs in previous literature suitable for e-learning. After the literature review, the paper moves on to the methodology. 

Concept Drift Detection in Production Datasets (Seminar Paper):
This paper starts by explaining the concept behind machine learning models and how they are developed. Then, it discusses model decay in a variety of forms, with the main focus being on concept drift. Next, it proceeds to delve into more details on concept drift and its types, as well as its detection methods. Naturally, it continues with methods to avoid or mitigate the drift of concept and its effects on the model at hand, all the while giving examples of solutions proposed in previous research.

Security and Privacy of Self-Driving Vehicles (Information Security Paper):
Industry experts predict that self-driving cars will be made available to the public population within the next five-to-ten years. However, this sort of heavy reliance on technology presents significant privacy and security issues that should be looked into prior to having these vehicles fully commercialized. This report delves into privacy issues of driverless cars, such as the privacy of owner and passenger information, location tracking, and sensor data about the vehicleâ€™s surroundings. It then tackles security issues such as hacking and software bugs. Another security issue is the controversial point of how the car should behave in case of an unavoidable accident.
